1) What is the difference between a functional and non-functional requirement?
   The functional requirements are the actual purpose of the program
   In addition to functional requirements, it is often desirable (or legally required) to specify some constraints about how the system should operate.
   We often call these non-functional requirements, because they tend to capture more broad themes than a specific piece of functionality.

2) Give two example functional requirements for Instagram.com
   - Must have a way to like posts
   - Must be able to see others posts

3) Give two example non-functional requirements for Instagram.com.
   - The font should be visible
   - There should be an age requirement for users

4) Draw a use case diagram for Instagram.com with at least three uses cases shown, where at least one use case extends another, and there are two actors.

5) Why has software engineering evolved to often embrace agile development models over waterfall ones?
   Waterfall method is pretty bad because it expects only a single user to actually use the program, expecting no bugs or changes later, while agile development allows for dynamic changes in the program later down the pipeline.

7) Draw a diagram where there are at least two interconnected paths: a critical path, and at least one non-critical path.
